# libefex

libefex is a cross-platform library for interacting with Allwinner chips in both FEL and FES modes. FEL is a low-level subroutine contained in the BootROM on Allwinner devices used for initial programming and recovery. FES mode is another BootROM subroutine used for more advanced flash operations.

## Features

- Scan and connect to Allwinner devices in FEL and FES modes
- Read and write device memory
- Execute code in device memory
- Flash programming and management
- Support for multiple processor architectures (ARM32, AARCH64, RISC-V32 E907)
- C language API interface
- Python bindings - WIP
- Rust bindings - WIP
